## Overview

The Incident Response Automation Script is a tool that allows for the automated isolation of systems identified as compromised during a security incident. The script provides a basic example of containment procedures and can serve as a starting point for custom implementations.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Appropriate permissions to execute system commands (iptables in this example)

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/incident-response-automation.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

    ```bash
    cd incident-response-automation
    ```

3. Modify the target IP address in the script (if needed).

4. Make the script executable:

    ```bash
    chmod +x containment_script.py
    ```

5. Run the script:

    ```bash
    ./containment_script.py
    ```

## Customization

The script is a basic example, and you may need to customize it based on your organization's specific requirements and security policies. Consider modifying the containment actions, adding validation steps, or integrating with your existing security infrastructure.

## Security Considerations

- Ensure that the script aligns with your organization's security policies.
- Test the script in a controlled environment before deploying it in a production setting.
- Regularly review and update the script to address any changes in security requirements.
